~ prologue
Voice of the Sanctum: Ah, thou hast arrived. I have been waiting.
Voice of the Sanctum: I am the Guardian, part of the magic that holds this world together. The world is in danger, and thou must help restore balance.
Voice of the Sanctum: The four orbs — Fire, Water, Earth, and Air — are scattered. They are the source of all magic. A sorcerer seeks to control them.
Voice of the Sanctum: Thou art chosen, for only one with a pure heart can succeed in this task. The orbs will listen to thee.
Voice of the Sanctum: The first lies within the fiery depths, guarded by a creature of flame. Only the brave may take it.

Voice of the Sanctum: The others are hidden: Water beneath the sea, Earth within the mountains, and Air high in the sky.
Voice of the Sanctum: The sorcerer’s power grows. If thou fail, all may be lost.
Voice of the Sanctum: Press one of the switches. Test your luck.
Voice of the Sanctum: Go now. The Fire Realm awaits.
